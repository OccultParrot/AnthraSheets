# 🧬 AntraSheets

**AntraSheets** is a web-based application for generating structured character sheets focused on **anthropology** — the study of humans and their traits, cultures, and lineage. It’s designed to help with roleplay, worldbuilding, or creative character design in speculative biology, sci-fi, fantasy, or historical settings.

  - **Milestones** (custom badges like :BRONZEMEDAL:, :DIAMONDMEDAL:)  
  - **Appearance** (dominant/recessive skin, eye color, mutations)  
  - **Family tree** (genetic lineage from parents)

## 🎭 Use Cases

Think of AntraSheets like this:

- You can create **fictional characters/species** for storytelling, worldbuilding, sci-fi, or fantasy.

- Or you can build **real species sheets** based on actual humans, animals, fossils, or biology.

The tool itself is flexible — it tracks traits, genetics, family trees, and milestones, which can apply to any kind of character or creature, real or imagined.
